# 603 Streaming Assignment – Real-Time Data Processing

This repository contains my submission for the **Streaming Assignment** in **DATA 603 – Big Data Architecture** at UMBC.

The objective of the assignment is to demonstrate real-time data ingestion, transformation, and output using PySpark. The notebook showcases how to set up a streaming data source, process data in real time using Spark APIs, and perform basic operations like filtering, aggregation, and writing to a sink.
